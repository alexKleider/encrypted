Dear June,

We so appreciate your June 6, 2024 donation of $100.00 USD to the
Internet Archive.


Your support ensures that students have access to books, teachers
have access to resources, scholars have access to research, and
that everyone has access to the web's memory.

We hope you stay engaged with the Internet Archive! One great way
is to subscribe to our monthly newsletter, where you can keep up
to date with the latest Archive news and explore hidden gems inside
our vast collections. Visit archive.org/subscribe to sign up.

Last but not least, the simplest way to support us is by using the
Archive and spreading the word to your friends and family. Since
we're a small team and we don't run ads, word of mouth is one of our
most powerful tools for building the library of the future.

Thank you again for your kind support. Together, we are ensuring
Universal Access To All Knowledge.

With much gratitude,

The Internet Archive Team
