New free software from the IRS
Mon 29 Jan 2024 08:54:46 AM PST

Direct File, the IRS’s own competitor to commercial tax
software, works a lot like TurboTax or other software by
asking yes-or-no questions and having you fill in
information from your tax documents. The IRS will start
inviting early users to try out the software in
mid-February, and by the end of this year’s tax season, it
will be open to everyone in Arizona, California, Florida,
Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. If you
live in those states, you can file your state taxes free as
well (if your state has an income tax).

However, Direct File can handle only certain tax situations.
If you have self-employment income, or if you want to claim
a tax credit for child-care expenses, for instance, you
can’t use the new program.
