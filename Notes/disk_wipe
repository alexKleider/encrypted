redbook addendum:
You know, if you want to start with a truly wiped disk format, just
write zeroes over the first 512 bytes:

#  dd if=/dev/zero /of=dev/sdb bs=512 count=1

Do that, and every aspect of filesystems, partition tables, volume
labels, etc. is just plain gone.

Now, as to your 1 TB drive, I'm pretty sure it's below the size where
/sbin/fdisk runs out of steam entirely, which I believe doesn't happen
until you try to create a filesystem larger than 1.5 TB, _but_ you
should, IMO, start thinking about using GNU parted instead of
/sbin/fdisk, and maybe also GPT-type partition tables instead of the
default IBM/Microsoft type.

(I have no direct experience, as I don't own any hard drives that big.)

Once you create ext3 partitions on there, use e2label to assign a name
to the device and this will be respected in the name it's assigned when
mounted.

Rick's comments may be a better way to go, but I believe what you need
to do in fdisk is run fdisk on the drive itself (/dev/sdb) rather than
partitions within it (/dev/sdb1). This will allow you to delete all
existing paritions, create new ones (and specify the right filesystem
type - most likely ext3).

Good luck!

Cheers, Tom
