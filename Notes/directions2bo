    Directions to Bolinas (Kleider homestead)

    445 Olema Bolinas Rd.
    Bolinas, CA 94924-0277

    From the South:
            From the Golden Gate Bridge continue North 
        on 101 over the Marin Headlands. Upon decending
        back down to sea level take the Hwy 1/Stinson
        Beach exit and follow the road for about one
        mile through a couple of stop lights as you
        pass under 101 and through a long S-curve
        until the next stop light at 'Tam Junction.'
        You will see an Arco station on your left.
        Turn left to continue along Hwy 1 which will
        take you through the outskirts of Mill Valley,
        down into and through Muir Beach and then
        along the coast into Stinson Beach. 
            From the Stinson Beach stop sign, continue
        along Hwy 1 (aka Shoreline Highway) for
        another 4.45 miles and then turn left at mile
        marker 17.00. (If you find yourself with no
        water on your left, you have gone too far.)
        In another 1/4 mile, turn left again onto the
        Olema-Bolinas Rd.
    From the North:
            Get yourself onto Hwy 1 and turn off to
        the right at mile marker 17.29 onto the
        Olema-Bolinas Rd.
    Once on the Olema-Bolinas Rd, you'll now be
        travelling Southward and in less than 1 mile
        look for a steep concrete driveway on your
        right at mile marker 0.92. Put your vehicle
        into low gear and make your way up the drive
        with a hair pin turn to the left at the top.
        That'll take you South to the main house about 
        300 feet along and on your left. Go past the
        main house to find parking: you may have to go
        all the way down the hill to the guest house
        where there is lots of room to park or at
        least turn around and park on the East (right) 
        side of the road on the way back.
